* Develope

** Charniak Parser 
It is famous and fantastic English parser developed by Eugene Charniak. (with Mark Johnson?).

The reason use Charniak Parser as a base to develop Chinese :
  + It's speedy! 10 times faster than some slow parsers.
  + It doesn't use seperate "POS tagger" (no difference with Rule parser)
  + It's lexicalized. make it accurate.
  + Code quality is rather high. (I have heavy comments for most code)

** Difficulties
  + Lack of document. Especially about detail of features.
  + Features selection and model generation for Chineseã€‚
 

** Version?
There are several versions of Charniak Parser. This one is a relative old one (without ReRank)
However its code size is also relatively small.
